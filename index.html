            <h1>Hello!</h1> 
            <p>My name is Leslie Zurita-Zavala and I'm in my third year of college, majoring in interactive and graphic design. I instantly fell in love with design ever since I had a project back in high school which was to create a book cover. I am currently working as an intern for the annuel Made in Millersville conference and have created some logos along with posters for the event. 
            <br></br> When it comes to aesthetics, I'm both drawn to art deco and pop art. My ultimate goal is to help small businesses by providing them with a unique brand that will assist them in their journey and ensure that they stand out from the rest.</p>
